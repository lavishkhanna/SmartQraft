The word polymorphism means having many forms. In simple words, we can define polymorphism as the ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form. A person at the same time can have different characteristics. A man at the same time is a father, a husband, and an employee. So the same person possesses different behavior in different situations. This is called polymorphism. An operation may exhibit different behaviors in different instances. The behavior depends upon the types of data used in the operation. C++ supports operator overloading and function overloading.

Operator Overloading: The process of making an operator exhibit different behaviors in different instances is known as operator overloading.
Function Overloading: Function overloading is using a single function name to perform different types of tasks. Polymorphism is extensively used in implementing inheritance.
Example: Suppose we have to write a function to add some integers, sometimes there are 2 integers, and sometimes there are 3 integers. We can write the Addition Method with the same name having different parameters, the concerned method will be called according to parameters.
